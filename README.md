#Analysis and Insights
J color and I1 clarity are worst featiures for a diamond, however when the data is plotted on bar graph, it is seen that the price of diamonds with J color and I1 clarity 
is higher than the price of diamonds with D color and IF clarity, which is opposite to what I expected.
Here is something interesting about the data. The price of the diamonds with J color and I1 clarity is higher than the price of the diamonds with D color and IF clarity which
couldn't be explained by the models. This could be because of the other factors thataffect the price of the diamond.
